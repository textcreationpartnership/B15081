            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <l>The Tree which now is father to a shade,</l>
                  <l>And often head against the winde hath made,</l>

                  <l>Nor as a signe of griefe their weeping take,</l>
                  <l>But thinke, their eyes, vse, soluble doth make.</l>
                  <l>Bee still and sullen, beare a grudge in minde,</l>
                  <l>Nor tell the cause least she excuses finde:</l>
                  <l>He that beginneth with his loue to chide,</l>
                  <l>That man is willing to bs satisfide.</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177747:13"/>
                  <l> Beauty is nothing worth, for if we loue,</l>
                  <l>The fowl'st she in our iudgement faire will proue:</l>
                  <l>Therefore the onely meanes by which to try them,</l>
                  <l>Is then to iudge when fairer do stand by them:</l>
                  <l>Conferre their faces and with all their minde,</l>
                  <l>Who seeth onely with his eyes is blinde.</l>
                  <l>Comparison, the touch-stone is, whereby,</l>
                  <l>We from the good the better do descry.</l>
                  <l>'Tis but a trifle which I meane to speake,</l>
                  <l>And yet, loues strength, this trifle oft doth breake.</l>
                  <l>All letters written from thy Mistresse, burne:</l>
                  <l>Such reliques, louers mindes do backwards turne.</l>
                  <l>Though thou canst not behold thÄ“ while they flame.</l>
                  <l>Thy loues last funerall fire, do thinke the same.</l>
                  <l>Take heed least thou into the place refort,</l>
                  <l>Which hath bene accessary to your sport:</l>
                  <l>Stirre not the ashes which do fire conceale,</l>
                  <l>Nor touch the wound which is about to heale.</l>
                  <l>Loue cannot be maintain'd with pouertie,</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177747:13"/>
                  <l> His ryot doth with riches best agree.</l>
                  <l>Honour and titles, though not felt nor seene,</l>
                  <l>The chiefest cause of loue to some haue bene.</l>
                  <l>Frequent not Plaies, for whiles we others loue,</l>
                  <l>See acted, we our selues do parties proue.</l>
                  <l>Vpon my proofe, Musicke and Dancing flie,</l>
                  <l>For Musicke, Trees and Stones did mollifie:</l>
                  <l>And fishes too though they themselues be dumbe</l>
                  <l>To heare <hi>Arions</hi> Harpe did gladly come.</l>
                  <l>And Dancing doth in some more Passions raise,</l>
                  <l>Then reason pacifies in many daies.</l>
                  <l>These melt the minde and soft our hearts do make,</l>
                  <l>And thereby loues impression apt to take.</l>
                  <l>Touch not the Poets which of loue do sing,</l>
                  <l>They vs to loue by imitation bring,</l>
                  <l>Whiles we in them do others loue behold,</l>
                  <l>Change but the names the Tale of vs is told.</l>
                  <l>What man (but some stiffe Clowne) but soone will proue</l>
                  <l>By reading of such bookes in loue, with loue?</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177747:14"/>
                  <l> Barre them I say, because in them is found,</l>
                  <l>A certaine musicke and a wanton sound.</l>
                  <l>Vnlesse I by <hi>Apollo</hi> be misled,</l>
                  <l>'Tis a mutation which most loue hath bred.</l>
                  <l>Much easinesse doth cloy, and most we set,</l>
                  <l>By that which we with doubt from others get:</l>
                  <l>Then frame this selfe me riuall, but surmise,</l>
                  <l>That cold in middle of her bed she lies.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Atrides</hi> could lye dull by <hi>Helens</hi> side,</l>
                  <l>And was content at <hi>Creet</hi> from her to bide.</l>
                  <l>Vntill by <hi>Paris</hi> she from him was rented,</l>
                  <l>Then was his loue by others loue augmented.</l>
                  <l>Lastly, I must some meates forbid the sicke,</l>
                  <l>That I in all may be Physition like:</l>
                  <l>Vse not on sweete and iuicy meates to feede,</l>
                  <l>Of such, the fulnesse, doth lusts hunger breede:</l>
                  <l>And stuff'd with such, we any do admire,</l>
                  <l>When all their beauty lies in our desire.</l>
                  <l>But Wine is more prouoking farre then meat,</l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177747:14"/>
                  <l> This heates our bloud and it on rage doth set.</l>
                  <l>This drownes our minde and makes it sence obey,</l>
                  <l>"Loues wings being wet he cannot flye away.</l>
